            <h2>Research Overview</h2>
            <p>Our laboratory investigates the critical role of ADAR2-mediated RNA editing in maintaining synaptic function and its dysregulation in Alzheimer's disease. We employ a multidisciplinary approach combining molecular biology, biochemistry, and advanced imaging techniques to understand how inflammatory signalling affects RNA editing patterns and synaptic stability.</p>

                <h3>Interferon Signalling and ADAR2 Regulation</h3>
                <p>Through detailed molecular analyses, we have identified specific interferon-responsive elements in the ADAR2 promoter region and characterised the signalling cascades that lead to its downregulation. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and protein-protein interaction studies, we have mapped the key transcriptional regulators involved in this process.</p>

                <h3>ADAR2 Interactome Analysis</h3>
                <p>Using a combination of co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and mass spectrometry approaches, we have identified novel ADAR2 interaction partners under inflammatory conditions. Our phosphoproteomics analyses have revealed specific post-translational modifications that regulate ADAR2 activity and stability.</p>

                <h3>Therapeutic Development</h3>
                <p>We are developing innovative AAV-based delivery systems for ADAR2 and edited GluA2(R). Our approach includes extensive validation using both in vitro neuronal cultures and in vivo mouse models of neurodegeneration, with careful attention to cell-type specificity and targeting efficiency.</p>
